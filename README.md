# Multimedia Runner 🏃‍♂️💻

Main developer of an endless runner videogame about Multimedia Engineering. It uses physical computing through a control driven by sensors and Arduino. We wanted to bring closer to users interested in the career to give them a great experience from actual students.

## 🌟 Features

- **Physical Computing**: Uses Arduino and various sensors to create a custom game controller.
- **Endless Runner Gameplay**: Engaging and fun gameplay style.
- **Educational Focus**: Aimed at introducing prospective and first-semester students to Multimedia Engineering.
- **Web Deployment**: Accessible online for easy access.

## 🚀 Technologies

- **GODOT**: Game engine used for development.
- **Arduino & ESP32**: Microcontrollers for the custom game controller.
- **HTML & JavaScript**: For additional web development.
- **GDScript**: Scripting language used in GODOT.
- **Gamification**: Elements to enhance user engagement.
- **SFX Management**: Sound effects integration.
- **Web Deploy**: Game deployment on the web.

## 📚 Project Overview

### Objective

This project was carried out with the aim of offering an introduction to prospective students and first-semester students of Multimedia Engineering. We built the controller from scratch using various sensors with Arduino, connected it to GODOT, and finally deployed the game on the web.

### Custom Controller

- **Sensors**: Utilized various sensors connected to an Arduino for interactive gameplay.
- **Connection to GODOT**: Integrated the physical controller with the GODOT game engine for real-time input.

### 3D Model Representation

- **Custom Controller Model**: This 3D model, created in Maya, represents the unconventional controller designed for the game. It includes the ESP32, sensors, and other components. You can view the 3D model [here](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/modelofinal-4409b79b69544a67bf05d1f4e8fe461d).
